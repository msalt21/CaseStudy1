%%TODO
% * identify problematic/outlier vectors in the training set (should be in their own clusters) and get rid of
% them --> run kmeans on the remaining vectors
% * for clusters with low silhouette values, run kmeans within those
% clusters to create new clusters
% * use some sort of weight function that takes into account (1) what
% proportion of the cluster is from the same division and (2) the total
% size of the cluster
% * change the parameters: (1) how many clusters (2) initiating the
% centrois (should we let kmeans handle this or try to come up with
% something ourselves?) (3) linear transformation?
